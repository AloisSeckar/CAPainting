Simple drawing program in Delphi

Written in Borland Delphi somewhere back to high school.

    You can use basic drawing functions on canvas (pen, fill, elipse, rectangle, ereaser).
    You can adjust line size and color.
    You can undo/redo.
    You can open/save bitmaps.

The repository was just restored from an old backup (2007-05-14) without any pruning or maintaining the code.

I don't plan to work on this program any further...
